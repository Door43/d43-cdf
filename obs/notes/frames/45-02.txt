**One day**, when Stephen was teaching about **Jesus**, some **Jews** who did not believe in Jesus began to argue with Stephen.

They said, “We heard him speak **evil** things about **Moses** and **God**!” So the religious leaders arrested Stephen and brought him to the **high priest** and the other leaders of the Jews, where more false **witnesses** lied about Stephen.
