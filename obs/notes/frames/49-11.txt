===== The Sinless Sacrifice [49-11] =====

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-49-11.jpg?nolink}}

**Jesus** never **sinned**, but he chose to be **punished** and to **die** as the perfect **sacrifice** to **take away** your sins and the sins of every person in the world. Because Jesus sacrificed himself, **God** can **forgive** any sin, even terrible sins.
