====== Asaph ======

===== Facts: =====

Asaph was a Levite priest and gifted musician who composed the music for the psalms of King David. He also wrote his own psalms.

  * Asaph was appointed by King David to be one of three musicians who were responsible for providing songs for worship in the temple. Some of these songs were also prophecies.
  * Asaph trained his sons and they carried on this responsibility, playing musical instruments and prophesying in the temple.
  * Some of the musical instruments included the lute, harp, trumpet, and cymbals.
  * Psalms 50 and 73-83 are said to be from Asaph. It may be that some of these psalms were written by his family members.
