===== Facts: =====

The Old Testament term "Arabah" often refers to a very large desert and plains region that includes the valley surrounding the Jordan River and extends south to the northern tip of the Red Sea.

  * The Israelites traveled through this desert region on their journey from Egypt to the land of Canaan.
  * The "Sea of the Arabah" could also be translated as, "sea located in the Arabah desert region." This sea is often referred to as the "Salt Sea" or the "Dead Sea."
  * The term "arabah" can also be a general reference to any desert region.
